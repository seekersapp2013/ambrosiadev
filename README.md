# Convex + Resend Demo

This is a [Convex](https://convex.dev/) project created with [`npm create convex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-convex) using [Resend](https://resend.com/) via the [Resend Component](https://www.convex.dev/components/resend).

## Stack

- [Convex](https://convex.dev/) as your backend (database, server logic).
- [Resend](https://resend.com/) for email sending.
- [Resend Component](https://www.convex.dev/components/resend):
  - Queueing: Send as many emails as you want, as fast as you want—they'll all be delivered (eventually).
  - Batching: Automatically batches large groups of emails and sends them to Resend efficiently.
  - Durable execution: Uses Convex workpools to ensure emails are eventually delivered, even in the face of temporary failures or network outages.
  - Idempotency: Manages Resend idempotency keys to guarantee emails are delivered exactly once, preventing accidental spamming from retries.
  - Rate limiting: Honors API rate limits established by Resend.
- [Convex Auth](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/) for authentication.

## Get started

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set up Convex Auth:
```
npx @convex-dev/auth
```

Follow the [Resend Component  instructions](https://www.convex.dev/components/resend) to get started.

In particular, make sure to set the environment variables:
```
npx convex env set RESEND_API_KEY "<your-api-key>"
```
Use this to make your webhook url:
```
npx convex env get CONVEX_SITE_URL
```
Set the webhook secret:
```
npx convex env set RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET "<your-webhook-secret>"
```

To log into the app, use the same email domain as you have set up in Resend.

For more information on how to configure Convex Auth, check out the [Convex Auth docs](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/).
